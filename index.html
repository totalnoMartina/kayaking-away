            If you want to make the most out of your vacation, then try experiencing
            the Mediterranean by joining me, a certified experienced kayak guide, on a
            kayaking adventure on our clear blue sea where you will hear interesting
            local stories and history, visit hidden beaches and enjoy a dip in the sea
            or snorkeling.

        You can choose from three routes, designed carefully to accommodate every
        type of traveler and fitness level:

        1) The panoramic tour: We will set out from Kačjak peninsula and kayak our
        way to the center of Crikvenica which will allow us to see most of the Crikvenica panorama. This tour is perfect for first timers and requires a medium fitness level. The tour finishes at Crikvenica’s small port Lučica and, if needed the transport back to the starting location is provided.
        Distance: about 7 km
        Duration: 2.5 hours

        2) Kačjak peninsula tour: a tour around Kačjak peninsula with bits of
        interesting local history and snorkeling included. Perfect for a medium
        fitness level and recharging.
        Distance: around 5 km
        Duration: 3 hours

        3) The adventurous route: Starting from Jadranovo, we will kayak across
        the sea to Maltempo lighthouse on Krk island with a stop for a short swimm,
        then continue alongside Krk to another lighthouse where we will cross back
        to a small cove in Jadranovo Lokvišća and finish our tour.
        Distance: 8km
        Duration: 3.5 hours

        I'm Kresimir and I am a professional basketball coach (bacc. cin.)
        and a certified kayak guide. Sport is my passion, especially kayaking.
        At sea I can relax and enjoy the views of my small town on the Adriatic.
        That's why I became a certified kayak guide because I want to share my passion
        for the sea and my town with others! I love traveling and meeting new people,
        and my wife and I are also experienced Airbnb hosts - we have our own rental
        so we really do have experience with tourism and we love to host!
